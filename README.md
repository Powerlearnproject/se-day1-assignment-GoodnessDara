#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Answer:
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. 
It involves the design, development, testing,deployment, and maintenance of software products.
Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern 
life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Answer:
Milestones include;
1. The development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C),
2. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s,
3. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s, and
4. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Answer:
1. Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
4. Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
6. Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Answer:
Waterfall is a Sequential, step-by-step process with changes dificult to implement while	Agile is an Iterative, flexible process that is highly adaptable to changes
The Project Phases for waterfall is Defined upfront (Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment) with user involvement minimal after initial requirements while for agile is divided into small cycles (Sprints) with continuous improvement and user involvement	is continuous and sometimes collaborative
Testing	Happens after development is completed	in waterfall methodology and delivered as a whole at the end while testing happens throughout the development process for agile methodology and is delivered in increments (working software early and often)

Examples
Waterfall
1. Government projects (e.g., national ID systems, tax processing software) where compliance and documentation are critical.
2. Construction and manufacturing software where strict, pre-planned processes must be followed.
3. Banking and financial systems where high security and regulatory approvals are required before implementation.

Agile
1. Startup software development (e.g., mobile apps, SaaS products) where user needs change rapidly.
2. E-commerce platforms (e.g., Amazon, Shopify) that require frequent updates based on market trends.
3. Game development where user testing and iteration improve engagement.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Answer
Software Developer are the Builder of the actual software—like a game, an app, or a website, they write code using programming languages like Python, Java, or JavaScript and They work on both the front end (what users see) and the back end (how the system works behind the scenes).

Quality Assurance Engineers the Tester that make sure the software works correctly and has no bugs (errors), run tests to check if features work as expected and report any problems and  ensure the software is fast, secure, and user-friendly.

Project Managers are the organizer that is the team leader who makes sure everything runs smoothly by planning the project, setting deadlines, and ensuring developers and testers are working together.They communicate with clients and the team to make sure the software meets expectations.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Answer
An Integrated Development Environment IDE is a software tool that provides a complete environment for writing, testing, and debugging code. It combines essential features like a code editor, debugger, and compiler into one platform, making coding easier and faster.

Importance of IDEs:
1. Improves Productivity – Provides features like autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and error detection to speed up development.
2. Debugging & Testing – Built-in debugging tools help developers identify and fix errors quickly.
3. Code Management – Offers project organization tools, making it easy to manage files and libraries.
4. Integration with Other Tools – Many IDEs support plugins and integrations with databases, frameworks, and VCS.

Examples of IDEs:
1. Visual Studio Code (VS Code) – A lightweight yet powerful IDE used for web and backend development.
2. PyCharm – Specially designed for Python development with advanced debugging and testing tools.
3. IntelliJ IDEA – Popular for Java development, offering deep code analysis.
4. Eclipse – Commonly used for Java and C++ development.

A Version Control System VCS is a system that helps developers track changes in code over time, collaborate with teammates, and revert to previous versions when needed. It is essential for teamwork and maintaining a history of changes in a project.

Importance of VCS:
1. Collaboration – Allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other’s code.
2. Version Tracking – Developers can track changes, compare versions, and revert to earlier versions if needed.
3. Backup & Security – Ensures that code is not lost due to accidental deletion or system crashes.
4. Branching & Merging – Developers can create separate branches to work on new features without affecting the main codebase.

Examples of VCS:
1. Git – The most widely used VCS, often paired with GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket for cloud storage.
2. Subversion (SVN) – An older VCS, still used in some enterprises for centralized version control.
3. Mercurial – A distributed VCS similar to Git, known for handling large projects efficiently.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Answer
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and optimizing prompts (input instructions) to effectively interact with AI models like ChatGPT, Bard, or Claude. It involves crafting precise, structured, and context-rich queries to get accurate, relevant, and high-quality responses from AI systems.

Why is Prompt Engineering Important?
1. Improves Response Accuracy: A well-crafted prompt helps AI understand the exact intent, reducing vague or incorrect answers.
2. Enhances Efficiency & Saves Time: Precise prompts reduce the need for revisions and clarifications. Helps businesses streamline AI usage for customer support, content creation, and automation.
3. Helps AI Understand Complex Queries: AI can sometimes misinterpret ambiguous questions. Prompt engineering provides context and clarity.
4. Boosts Creativity & Problem-Solving: Well-structured prompts guide AI to generate creative ideas, code, designs, or strategies.
5. Critical for AI-Powered Applications: AI-driven tools (chatbots, virtual assistants, and automated workflows) rely on well-structured prompts to deliver accurate, human-like interactions.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Answer:
Vague: "Tell me about technology."
Why it’s vague?
Too broad – "Technology" covers everything from AI to smartphones, space travel, and medical innovations.
No clear direction – Does the user want a history, current trends, or future predictions?
No constraints – It doesn't specify length, focus, or depth of response.

Improved Prompt:"Explain how artificial intelligence is transforming customer service, with examples of AI-powered chatbots and automation tools."
Why it’s more effective?
Clear focus – Specifies AI in customer service instead of general "technology."
Detailed scope – Mentions "chatbots and automation tools" to guide the response.
Concise and direct – Eliminates ambiguity, making it easier for AI to generate a relevant answer.
